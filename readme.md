# Guess Vu! 
![Logo](https://i.imgur.com/IjiUPCKb.png)

Engineering project two for Makers Apprencticeships (Weeks 11 & 12). A small  anonymous messaging app/chatroom where you try and figure out the identities of others in the chatroom.

* Hosted at [Guess Vu](https://guessvu.herokuapp.com/) (https://guessvu.herokuapp.com/)
* [Team Trello board](https://trello.com/b/ZrjQm3jB/guessvu)

## Prerequisites

[NodeJs & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which can be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS:
```sh
brew install npm
```

## Installing

Clone this repo then `cd` into the directory:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:IvyMic/guessVu.git
cd guessVu
```

Install packages in the backend/main folder:
```sh
npm install
```

Then install packages in the frontend folder:
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Running The Server
If changes have been made rebuild the `frontend` package:
```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the server in the `root`:
```sh
npm start
```

Visit [localhost:3001](localhost:3001) to chat and play with the application locally

## Running Tests

With the server running in `root` (see above):
```
npm test
```

<!-- ### Break down tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And feature tests

<!-- ## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system -->

## Process
* Two day sprints
* Group planning session at the start of a sprint
* Daily standups
* Retros at the end of each sprint with Demos

### Planning
* Plan and estimate work for sprint (plus extra just in case)
* Estimations used are relating to either morning (9.30am-12.30pm) or afternoon (1.30pm-5.30pm) sessions:
  * *Quick and Easy* - Multiple tickets completable in single session
  * *Medium* - Ticket expected to take whole session
  * *SuperHard* - Ticket expected to take more than one session, should be broken down into smaller tickets if possible
* Break up large tickets into smaller ones if possible (see "SuperHard")
* Create checklists on tickets as necessary
* Add estimated tickets to the `To Do` column in the [group trello board](https://trello.com/b/ZrjQm3jB/guessvu)

### Development
* Pairs assign themselves to a ticket in the `To Do` column and move it across to `In Progress`
* All development work takes place in a new branch which is linked to the ticket
* When the task is complete  <!-- and continuous integration is passing on GitHub --> make a pull request with appropriate tags and requesting approval from the other pair before moving the ticket to `In Review`
  * Pull request must have at least basic information on what is being added to the codebase
  * Pull request linked to ticket on [trello](https://trello.com/b/ZrjQm3jB/guessvu)
* Code must be reviewed by the other pair and approvals given before code is merged. Approval only given if reviewers understand how the code works and thinks it's suitable and of good quality.
  * Comments and discussion had on the pull request if necessary before approving
* Move the ticket into `Done` once merged
* Repeat ad infinitum

### MVP Sketch
Single page app with landing page asking for real name and fake (display) name, moving through to WebSocket-based chatroom with the ability to guess the real names of people in the chatroom and receive feedback
